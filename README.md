# Color scheme hue shifter

If you've ever wished what your code editor's color scheme would look like if you could just hue-shift all the colors a bit, this utility might be useful.

Paste a theme (like a Sublime Text theme) into the input textarea, then use the left and right arrow keys to shift the hues of all the colors. Grab the resulting theme from the output textarea.

Colors need to be in six-digit hex format preceded by a hash (#RRGGBB).
